# Brain F Interpreter and Compiler
This is a interpreter and compiler for the esoteric language BrainF written in x86 assembly and C, respectively.

##### For The Compiler
* `gcc compiler.c -o compiler`
* `./compiler <script>#`

### Still a work in progress...
The interpreter will not work in all situtuations.  For some scripts including nested loops using `[]` the results will not be 
correct.
